As of recent years, ADHD and other learning disabilities have become more and more frequent and this is observable in classrooms. This strongly affects learning styles and adaptability. I personally believe that learning styles affect how everybody learns, not just one person. Over time we've seen the most common styles of learning; visual, auditory, and physical. I would say that most people fit into these categories, but also, learning disabilities like ADHD or dyslexia make learning difficult for specific children. It's hard to cater to just one kid. I've personally had teachers who teach one certain way but I don't learn that way easily so it makes the course harder to understand. It really depends on the teacher and the circumstances of all the kids in the class.
